#This script sets up a tic tac toe board as a list of 9 spaces, represented by ' '. It then defines functions for printing the board, allowing a player to make a move, checking for a victory condition, and checking for a draw condition. The game loop then alternates between player 1 and player 2, prompting them to make a move and checking for a win or draw condition after each move. The game ends when either player wins or the board is filled without a winner.
